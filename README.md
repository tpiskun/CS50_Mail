# Project 3

Project3 Submission for Harvard's CS50: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript Course.

## Motivation
To further master the JavaScript, Python, CSS, and HTML skills needed for front-end development, this project is an example of a modern tech stack. This project is similar to the "Mail" Application and uses custom written API's to allow a user to register an account, login, receive an email, send an email, reply to an email, and toggle between archiviving an email.

## Build Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/username/projectname.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/username/projectname)

## Features
This project is client-side and therefore allows the to do the following:
* Send Mail: When a user submits the email composition form, the JavaScript will call the appropriate API to send the email.
  * values for recipients, subject, and body are required
* Mailbox: When a user visits their Inbox, Sent mailbox, or Archive, the appropriate mailbox is loaded
  * When a mailbox is visited, the application will query the API for the latest emails in that mailbox.
  * When a mailbox is visited, the name of the mailbox will appear at the top of the page.
* Emails: Each email will display who the email is from, what the subject line is, and the timestamp of the email.
  * If the email is unread, it will appear with a white background
  * If the email has been read, it will appear with a gray background.
* Archive: Allow users to archive and unarchive emails that they have received.
  * Once an email has been archived or unarchived, the user's indbox will be loaded
* Reply: Allows user to reply to an email 
  * The composition form will be Pre-filled with the recipient field set to whoever sent the original email.
  * The subject line will be prefilled and a 'Re:' will be added to the original subject line

## Installation
This project requires Django.

## API Reference
To get, send, and update emails this applicationâ€™s uses its own APIs.

Querying through emails:

|Get/emails/<str:mailbox>|

Sending a GET| request to /emails/<mailbox>| where <mailbox>| is either inbox|, sent|, or archive| will return back to you (in JSON form) a list of all emails in that mailbox, in reverse chronological order. For example, if you send a GET| request to /emails/inbox|, you might get a JSON response like the below (representing two emails):

```
[
    {
        "id": 100,
        "sender": "foo@example.com",
        "recipients": ["bar@example.com"],
        "subject": "Hello!",
        "body": "Hello, world!",
        "timestamp": "Jan 2 2020, 12:00 AM",
        "read": false,
        "archived": false
    },
    {
        "id": 95,
        "sender": "baz@example.com",
        "recipients": ["bar@example.com"],
        "subject": "Meeting Tomorrow",
        "body": "What time are we meeting?",
        "timestamp": "Jan 1 2020, 12:00 AM",
        "read": true,
        "archived": false
    }
]
```
